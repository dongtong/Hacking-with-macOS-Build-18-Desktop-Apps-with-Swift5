## 01_Codable

```swift
struct Language: Codable {

    var name: String
    var versions: Int
}

let swift = Language(name: "Swift", versions: 4)
let php = Language(name: "PHP", versions: 7)
let perl = Language(name: "Perl", versions: 6)

let encoder = JSONEncoder()

if let encoded = try? encoder.encode(swift) {
    if let json = String(data: encoded, encoding: .utf8) {

        print(json)
    }

    let decoder = JSONDecoder()

    if let decoded = try? decoder.decode(Language.self, from: encoded) {
        print(decoded.name)
    }
}
```

## 02_複数行文字列

```swift
let longString = """
When you write a string that spans multiple lines make sure you start its content on a line all of its own, and end it with three quotes also on a line of their own. Multi-line strings also let you write "quote marks" freely inside your strings, which is great!
"""
```

## 03_Key Value Coding

- [Swift4のKeyPathを学ぶ](https://qiita.com/BlueEventHorizon/items/dee0eb27fbba83ed8ea9)

```swift
//an example struct
struct Crew {
    var name: String
    var rank: String
}

//another example struct, this time with a method struct Starship
struct Starship {
    var name: String
    var maxWarp: Double
    var captain: Crew

    func gotToMaximumWarp () {
        print("\(name) is now travelling at warp \(maxWarp)")
    }
}

//create instances of those two structs
let janeway = Crew(name: "Kathryn Janeway", rank: "Captain")
let voyager = Starship(name: "Voyager", maxWarp: 9.975, captain: janeway)

//grab a reference to the goToMaximumWarp() method
let enterWarp = voyager.gotToMaximumWarp

//call that reference
enterWarp()

let nameKeyPath = \Starship.name
let maxWarpKeyPath = \Starship.maxWarp
let captainName = \Starship.name

let starshipName = voyager[keyPath: nameKeyPath]
let starshipMaxWarp = voyager[keyPath: maxWarpKeyPath]
let starshipCaptain = voyager[keyPath: captainName]
```

## 04_Dictionaryの強化

- [Swift4\.0でDictionaryが大幅にパワーアップした](https://qiita.com/hanawat/items/341a6f7843f4e19780b5#grouping%E3%81%97%E3%81%9Fdictionary%E3%82%92%E7%B0%A1%E5%8D%98%E3%81%AB%E7%94%9F%E6%88%90%E3%81%A7%E3%81%8D%E3%82%8B)


```swift
let cities = ["Shanghai": 24_256_800, "Karachi": 23_500_000, "Beijing": 21_516_000, "Seoul": 9_995_000]
let massiveCities = cities.filter { $0.value > 10_000_000 }

let populations = cities.map { $0.value * 2 }
let roundedCities = cities.mapValues { "\($0 / 1_000_000) million people" }

let groupedCities = Dictionary(grouping: cities.keys) { $0.count }
print(groupedCities)

let person = ["name": "Taylor", "city": "Nashville"]
let name = person["name", default: "Anonymous"]

let name2 = person["name"] ?? "Anonymous"
```

- 出現数カウントをカウントするあれを簡単にかける

```swift
var favoriteTVShows = ["Red Dwarf", "Blackadder", "Fawlty Towers", "Red Dwarf"]
var favoriteCounts = [String: Int]()

for show in favoriteTVShows {
    favoriteCounts[show, default: 0] += 1
}
```

```sh
["Fawlty Towers": 1, "Blackadder": 1, "Red Dwarf": 2]
```


## 05_String, 配列の強化

```swift
let quote = "It is a truth universally acknowledged that Swift versions bring new features."
let reversed = quote.reversed()

for letter in quote {

    print(letter)
}

let characters = ["Dr Horrible", "Captain Hammer", "Penny", "Bad Horse", "Moist"]
let bigParts = characters[..<3]
let smallerParts = characters[3...]
print(bigParts)
print(smallerParts)
```
